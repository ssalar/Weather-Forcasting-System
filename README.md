# Weather-Forcasting-System

Weather forecasting systems use a combination of science and technology to make accurate predictions on weather conditions of a particular location at a particular time. Weather forecast systems and applications predict weather conditions based on multiple parameters, such as pressure, temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.

This weather forecasting project is a web application. It has a graphical user interface where users can log in via their user ID and password. This weather forecast application is different from the conventional weather forecast systems where you only enter the location.

However, in this application, the users will manually enter the current parameters of a location, and the system will predict the weather conditions of the place by using historical data stored in the database. The Admin continually updates the database by entering the data of past weather conditions. Since the system mainly relies on historical data, the predictions will be much more accurate and reliable.
